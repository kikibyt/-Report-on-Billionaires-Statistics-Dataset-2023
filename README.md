Pearson correlation coefficients between wealth and various economic indicators. 

1. **Pearson Correlation between Wealth and GDP: 0.02**
   - Interpretation: A correlation coefficient of 0.02 indicates a very weak positive correlation between wealth and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The correlation is close to zero, suggesting that there is almost no linear relationship between the two variables.

2. **Pearson Correlation between Wealth and CPI: -0.07**
   - Interpretation: A correlation coefficient of -0.07 suggests a weak negative correlation between wealth and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Although the correlation is still relatively close to zero, the negative sign implies a slight tendency for wealth to decrease as CPI increases, and vice versa.

3. **Pearson Correlation between Wealth and Total Tax Rate: -0.10**
   - Interpretation: A correlation coefficient of -0.10 indicates a weak negative correlation between wealth and the total tax rate. Similar to the previous case, the negative correlation suggests that there might be a slight tendency for wealth to decrease as the total tax rate increases.

### Correlation Analysis: Education and Wealth

#### Pearson Correlation Coefficients

The dataset reveals interesting insights into the correlation between wealth and education enrollment at the tertiary and primary levels:

#### Wealth and Tertiary Enrollment:
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient: 0.09**
- A positive correlation coefficient of 0.09 suggests a modest, positive relationship between an individual's wealth and the tertiary education enrollment rate of their respective country.
- While the correlation is not exceptionally strong, it indicates that, on average, countries with higher tertiary education enrollment rates may have individuals with higher wealth. However, causation cannot be inferred solely from correlation.

#### Wealth and Primary Enrollment:
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient: 0.01**
- The correlation coefficient of 0.01 implies a very weak positive correlation between wealth and the primary education enrollment rate.
- In this case, the correlation is close to zero, suggesting that there is almost no linear relationship between an individual's wealth and the primary education enrollment rate in their country.

### Interpretation:
- The positive correlations, though relatively small, hint at potential associations between wealth and education. Higher wealth might be associated with higher tertiary education enrollment, indicating a possible trend where wealthier individuals are more likely to pursue higher education.


### Conclusion:
Understanding the correlation between wealth and education enrollment is crucial for policymakers and researchers. While these correlations provide valuable insights, further investigation and consideration of multiple factors are essential for a holistic understanding of the dynamics at play in wealth and education relationships.
 
PEARSON CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE AND WEALTH 
The pearson correlation between age and wealth is 0.11. This value indicates a weak positive linear relationship between the two variables. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 signifies a perfect positive correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and -1 represents a perfect negative correlation. In this case, the positive correlation suggests that, on average, as age increases, wealth tends to increase slightly. However, the strength of this relationship is considered weak.
